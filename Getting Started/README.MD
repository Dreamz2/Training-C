# Getting Started
Hope you enjoyed that awesome look into software development. Now we will start learning how to code your first program. But first, we need to figure out which language you should start with. Like I said before, every coding language has its syntax you need to know. Some are harder to learn, and some are simpler and cleaner. Ultimately by the end of this whole repository, you and I would have started an Application together.   

## Choose your language  

So, there are a ton of programming languages out there. Like JavaScript, Java, C#, C++, python, etc. For now, since you do not know any programming languages and syntax. I recommend Python as your first language. It is mainly used for back-end support for anything, and it is by far the easiest language to learn. But if you want something like python and a little more complex, I recommend JavaScript. JavaScript is more versatile, and it's used on all websites, but you will need to learn a little bit of HTML (A Markup language) and CSS (A Styling language) to use JavaScript to its full potential.  

Some sites I recommend getting started with coding   

[Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)  

> One of the best sites I would say for just learning a language. Everything is free but you will have to sign up with an email. It does step by step teaching you one thing at a time in the language you want to learn. This will teach you HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python.  

[Code Cademy](https://www.codecademy.com/)  

> I have used it a bit before and there is a lot more on it now than in the past. It is kind of the same as Free code camp but with a different approach to teaching. You will have to sign up, it's free and there is a paid option, but there are just more questions about the chapter you are on. I would say use this site when you have a grasp of a language. Then find a field that specializes in that language on the site to learn more about it. This will teach you more about Frameworks for a language  

[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)  

> This is a new site I found that is quite good for being a frontend or full-stack developers (More on those later). I am probably going to use it as well to learn a couple of things.
